Project Objective:
------------------
Build a fully customizable, multi-tenant enterprise admin application. The system must allow any customer (company) to configure their own users, user categories, master data and hierarchy, UI (menus, pages, fields, actions), and workflow logic, all without any code changes. All business logic, access control, and UI structure must be handled in the database, with no hardcoded conditions or data in the codebase. The application must be production-ready, scalable, and follow the rules and conventions described in prompt.txt.

Key Rules & Conditions (from prompt.txt):
-----------------------------------------
- All logic and configuration must be in the database (no hardcoding in code).
- 5 mandatory fields for all tables: status, createdBy, updatedBy, createdAt, updatedAt.
- Naming conventions:
  - snake_case: MySQL table names, API endpoints, env vars, request/response headers
  - camelCase: folder names, variables, function params
  - PascalCase: class names, function names, React components, TS interfaces/types
- Backend: NestJS, Prisma ORM, MySQL
- Frontend: React (Vite, TypeScript + swc), Redux, Tailwind CSS, shadcn
- UI and access must be dynamically driven by DB (UiMenu, UiPage, etc.)
- Multi-tenant: all data and config is company-specific

Current Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY
-----------------------------------
✅ Backend and Prisma schema reviewed and validated. The DB structure supports all required customizability, logic-in-DB, and multi-tenancy.
✅ Backend modules and entities are modular and follow best practices.

✅ Dynamic UI configuration system implemented (UiMenu, UiPage, UiField, UiAction).
✅ JWT-based authentication integrated between frontend and backend.
✅ Redux store configured with UI configuration state management.
✅ Environment configuration files created for both backend and frontend.
✅ API integration between frontend and backend completed.
✅ Dynamic menu and page rendering components implemented.
✅ Production deployment configuration and documentation completed.
✅ Error handling and validation implemented.
✅ CORS configuration properly set up.
✅ Database seeding with UI configuration completed.

Next Steps for Deployment:
--------------------------
1. Set up production database with proper credentials
2. Configure production environment variables
3. Set strong JWT secrets for production
4. Configure CORS origins for production domains
5. Set up SSL/HTTPS certificates
6. Configure database backups
7. Set up monitoring and logging
8. Deploy backend to production server
9. Deploy frontend to web server/CDN
10. Run end-to-end testing in production environment

The application is now production-ready and can be deployed to a production environment following the setup instructions in the README.md file.

## Database Structure Analysis (2025-07-02):

Analyzed three database structure proposals to create an optimized DB structure:

1. **First Structure (db_stuct1.sql)**:
   - Pros: Most comprehensive, with good separation of concerns, workflow systems, and audit logs.
   - Cons: Could become complex and less flexible for some hierarchical structures.

2. **Second Structure (db_struct2.txt)**:
   - Pros: Simple and concise with adjacency list pattern for hierarchy.
   - Cons: Lacks workflow, UI customization, and audit features.

3. **Third Structure (db_struct3.txt)**:
   - Pros: Good focus on dynamic master structure and customer configuration.
   - Cons: Less comprehensive privilege management.

**Final Implementation**: 
We've chosen to build upon the most robust structure (db_stuct1.sql) with enhancements for dynamic UI configuration and additional customizability. The key enhancements include:

1. **Complete UI configuration via database**: Menu, pages, fields, actions, and table columns are all stored in the database and company-specific.

2. **Enhanced master data flexibility**: All master hierarchies and relationships are stored in the database, with no hardcoded connections.

3. **User privilege system**: Role-based permissions with the ability to override at the individual user level.

4. **Workflow engine**: Configurable workflow steps and approval processes for entity operations.

5. **Audit and logging**: Complete tracking of all changes and user activities.

6. **Business rules engine**: Store rules in the database that determine behavior, validation, and logic.

This structure ensures that the entire application is configurable without code changes, meeting the core requirement of full customizability.

## Enhanced Schema Implementation (2025-07-02):

After analyzing the existing project code, we've enhanced the Prisma schema to include additional tables for full customizability:

1. **DynamicForm & DynamicFormField**: Added these models to allow for custom form creation for any entity type, completely configurable from the database. This enables customers to define their own form layouts, field types, validation rules, and more.

2. **BusinessRule**: Implemented a rules engine that allows defining business rules (validation, transformations, workflows) directly in the database. This makes it possible to implement complex business logic without code changes.

3. **ApiEndpoint**: Added support for dynamically defining API endpoints, including their handlers and required privileges. This allows for creating custom endpoints for specific customer needs without touching the codebase.

4. **Enhanced UI components**: Improved the UiField model with additional properties for validation, options, and placeholders to support more advanced form controls.

These enhancements ensure that virtually all aspects of the application can be configured via the database, including:
- UI structure and appearance- Data models and relationships- Business logic and validation rules
- API endpoints and data processing
- Workflow processes
- User access control and permissions

With these changes, we now have a truly customizable enterprise application framework that can adapt to any customer's specific needs without requiring code changes.

## Implementation of Customization Features (2025-07-02):

We've implemented a comprehensive set of customization features to make the application fully configurable without code changes:

1. **Backend Implementation**:
   - Created database models and controllers for business rules, dynamic forms, and API endpoints.
   - Implemented services to handle rule validation, form rendering, and dynamic API execution.
   - Extended the NestJS application to include the new customization modules.
   - All business logic is now stored in the database, not hardcoded in the application code.

2. **Frontend Implementation**:
   - Added Redux slices for managing state of business rules, dynamic forms, and API endpoints.
   - Created UI components for listing, creating, editing, and executing customization features.
   - Implemented navigation and routing for the new customization pages.
   - Updated the application menu to include the new customization options.

3. **User Interface**:
   - Added dedicated pages for business rules, dynamic forms, and API endpoints.
   - Created intuitive interfaces for configuring business rules with conditions and actions.
   - Implemented a form builder interface for creating and editing dynamic forms.
   - Added an API endpoint configuration tool with testing capabilities.

4. **Integration**:
   - Connected the business rules engine to entity validation and processing.
   - Integrated dynamic forms into data entry workflows.
   - Set up API endpoints to be executable from the admin interface.
   - Added proper authorization checks to ensure only users with configuration privileges can access these features.

The application now fully supports the required customization capabilities and can be deployed to customers without requiring code changes for adapting to different organizational structures and business rules.
